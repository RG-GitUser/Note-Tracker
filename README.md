# Note Tracker

## Description
In this project, I have showcased my skills in express.js, deploying a note tracker application to Heroku. 

### Installation
From the "Note-Tracker" repository (https://github.com/RG-GitUser/Note-Tracker) select the "Code" dropdown.
Using the "Code" dropdown, click on "SSH".
On the "SSH" tab, select the "copy" button next to the address.
Next, open your git bash terminal (or for mac users, homebrew)
Use the command "git clone" and "insert coppied SSH key here" then press enter.
Enter the "cd "enter path here" " command to navigate to the correct directory.
You now have the repository cloned to your system! To verify, the command "ls" to view the items listed inside of the repository.


### Usage

Users are able to keep track of their daily tasks by creating, saving, and deleting notes from the "Note Tracker" application.
